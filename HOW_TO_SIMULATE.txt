HOW TO TEST WITH CUSTOM SYSTEM CLOCK FREQUENCIES
==========================================================

This IP is designed to be flexible. To test the Baud Rate 
Generator with your specific system clock:

1. In 'rtl/baud_gen_design.v':
   Locate the parameter: parameter SYS_CLK_FREQ = 50000000;
   Change '50000000' to your desired frequency in Hz.

2. In 'tb/baud_gen_tb.v':
   Ensure the localparam/parameter SYS_CLK_FREQ matches 
   the design value to ensure the verification 
   checkers align correctly.

3. Randomized Testing:
   The testbench is configured to randomize the BAUD_RATE 
   input. This ensures the divider logic is robust across 
   various standard and non-standard baud requirements.

Simply re-run your simulation after these changes!
